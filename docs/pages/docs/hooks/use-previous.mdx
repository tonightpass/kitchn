# usePrevious

The `usePrevious` hook allows you to capture and use the previous value of a state or prop in a React component. This can be particularly useful when you need to compare the current value with its previous state, such as implementing animations, tracking changes, or conditionally executing logic based on value changes.

## Usage

First, you need to import the `usePrevious` hook from the `kitchn` package.

```jsx
import { usePrevious } from "kitchn";
```

## Example

Here is an example of how to use the `usePrevious` hook in a component:

<Playground
code={`
() => {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0);
  const prevCount = usePrevious(count);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (prevCount !== undefined && prevCount !== count) {
      console.log(\`Count changed from $\{prevCount} to $\{count}\`);
    }
  }, [count, prevCount]);

  return (
    <Container gap={"tiny"}>
      <Text>Current Count: {count}</Text>
      <Text>Previous Count: {prevCount}</Text>

      <Button
        onClick={() => setCount((prev) => prev + 1)}
      >
        Increment Count
      </Button>
    </Container>
  );
};
`}
/>

## Parameters

The `usePrevious` hook accepts the following parameters:

| Name    | Type | Description
|---------|------|---------------------------------------------------
| `state` | `T`  | The current state or prop whose previous value you want to track.

## Return Value

The `usePrevious` hook returns a tuple with the following elements:

| Name        | Type                         | Description
|-------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------
| `prevState` | `T` or `undefined` or `null` | The previous value of the state or prop passed to the hook.
