# useSSR

The `useSSR` hook allows you to identify whether your code is running in a server-side or client-side environment. This is particularly useful for handling logic that should only execute in the browser, such as DOM manipulations or accessing browser-specific APIs.

## Usage

First, you need to import the `useSSR` hook from the `kitchn` package.

```jsx
import { useSSR } from "kitchn";
```

## Example

Here is an example of how to use the `useSSR` hook in a component:

<Playground
code={`
() => {
  const { isBrowser, isServer } = useSSR();

  return (
    <Container>
      <Text>Is this running in the browser? {isBrowser ? "Yes" : "No"}</Text>
      <Text>Is this running on the server? {isServer ? "Yes" : "No"}</Text>
    </Container>
  );
};
`}
/>

## Parameters

The `useSSR` hook does not accept any parameters.

## Return Value

The `useSSR` hook returns an object with the following properties:

| Name        | Type       | Description
|-------------|------------|---------------------------------------------------
| `isBrowser` | `boolean`  | `true` if the code is running in the browser; `false` otherwise.
| `isServer	` | `boolean`  | `true` if the code is running on the server; `false` otherwise.
