<Playground

() => {
  const ref = React.useRef(null);

  const handleClickAway = (event) => {
    console.log("Clicked outside of the element", event);
  };

  useClickAway(ref, handleClickAway);

  return (
    <Container ref={ref} p={"normal"} bg={"dark"}>
      <Text>Click outside this box to trigger the event.</Text>
    </Container>
  );
};
`}
/>

## Parameters

The `useClickAway` hook accepts the following parameters:
