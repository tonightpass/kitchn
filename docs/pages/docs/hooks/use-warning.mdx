# useWarning

The `useWarning` hook provides a way to log warnings to the console in a consistent and controlled manner. This hook is particularly useful for development purposes, allowing you to flag potential issues in your code with clear messages that can optionally be associated with a specific component.

## Usage

First, you need to import the `useWarning` hook from the `kitchn` package.

```jsx
import { useWarning } from "kitchn";
```

## Example

Here is an example of how to use the `useWarning` hook in a component:

<Playground
code={`
() => {
  useWarning("This is a warning message", "ExampleComponent");

  return (
    <Text>Check the console for a warning message.</Text>
  );
};
`}
/>

## Parameters

The `useWarning` hook accepts the following parameters:

| Name        | Type       | Description
|-------------|------------|---------------------------------------------------
| `isBrowser` | `boolean`  | `true` if the code is running in the browser; `false` otherwise.
| `isServer	` | `boolean`  | `true` if the code is running on the server; `false` otherwise.

## Return Value

The `useWarning` hook does not return any value.
