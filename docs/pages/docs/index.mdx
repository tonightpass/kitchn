# Introduction

Kitchn is a [styled-components](https://styled-components.com) suite of components that are designed to work together to create a beautiful and consistent UI. Inspired by [Geist](https://geist-ui.dev/) and [Vercel Design](https://vercel.com/design) with a focus on simplicity and ease of use. This library is maintained by [Tonight Pass](https://tonightpass.com).

**What do you mean by "styled-components suite of components"?**
