# Getting Started with Next.js (App Router)

## Automatic Installation

### Template

To generate the starter template for your Next.js project, run the following command:

```sh
npx create-next-app@latest --example https://github.com/tonightpass/kitchn/tree/master/examples/next-app my-next-kitchn-app

cd my-next-kitchn-app
npm run dev
```

### What's Included

This template is similar to the default Next.js template, but with Kitchn pre-installed.

#### Pre-install dependencies

- `kitchn`
- `next`
- `react`
- `react-dom`

## Manual Installation

### Installation
In your Next.js project, install Kitchn by running either of the following:

```sh npm2yarn
npm i kitchn --save
```

### Provider Setup

After installing Kitchn, you need to set up the `KitchnRegistry` and `KitchnProvider` 
at the root of your application.

Go to `app/layout.js` or `app/layout.tsx` (create it if it doesn't exist) and
wrap the `KitchnProvider` with the `KitchnRegistry` and the `children` with the `KitchnProvider`:

```jsx
// app/layout.js
import { KitchnProvider } from "kitchn";
import { KitchnRegistry } from "kitchn/next";

export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html>
      <body>
        <KitchnRegistry>
          <KitchnProvider>{children}</KitchnProvider>
        </KitchnRegistry>
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

### Server Side Rendering
Now that everything is working you should be interested in Server Side Rendering.

Go to the `next.config.js` file and add the following:

```js
// next.config.js
const { withKitchnConfig } = require("kitchn/next");

const config = {
  // your next config
};

module.exports = withKitchnConfig(config);
```
