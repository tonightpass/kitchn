# Error

Good error design is clear, useful, and friendly. Designing concise and accurate error messages unblocks users and builds trust by meeting people where they are.

## Usage

First of all, you need to import the `Error` component from the `kitchn` package.

```js
import { Error } from "kitchn"
```

## Default

<Playground
  code={`
  <Error>This email address is already in use.</Error>
`}
/>

## Custom Label

<Playground
  code={`
  <Error label="Email Error">This email address is already in use.</Error>
`}
/>

## No Label

<Playground
  code={`
  <Error label={false}>This email address is already in use. </Error>
`}
/>

## Sizes

<Playground
  code={`
<Container direction={["column", "row", "row"]} top>
  <Container left>
    <Error size="small">This email is in use.</Error>
  </Container>
  <Container left>
    <Error>This email is in use.</Error>
  </Container>
  <Container left>
    <Error size="large">This email is in use.</Error>
  </Container>
</Container>
`}
/>

## Multiline

<Playground
  code={`
<Container>
  <Container>
    <Error size="small">A valid email address is required so that we can verify your GitHub installation. In the event that you cannot provide a valid email address, please contact support.</Error>
  </Container>
  <Container>
    <Error>A valid email address is required so that we can verify your GitHub installation. In the event that you cannot provide a valid email address, please contact support.</Error>
  </Container>
  <Container>
    <Error size="large">A valid email address is required so that we can verify your GitHub installation. In the event that you cannot provide a valid email address, please contact support.</Error>
  </Container>
</Container>
`}
/>

## With an `error` property

<Playground
  code={`
<Error 
  error={{ 
    message: "The request failed.", 
    action: "Contact Us", 
    link: "mailto:contact@tonightpass.com" 
  }}
/>
`}
/>
