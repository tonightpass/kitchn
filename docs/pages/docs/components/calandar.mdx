The Calendar component is a versatile date selection system that allows users to choose dates in three different modes: single selection, multiple selection, or date range selection.

## Usage

import { Calendar } from "kitchn"
Modes
Single Mode
In single mode, the user can select one date.

<Calendar
mode={"single"}
selected={selected}
onSelect={setSelected}
/>
`}
/>
Multiple Mode
In multiple mode, the user can select several dates.
<Playground

`}
/>
Range Mode
In range mode, the user can select a date range.
