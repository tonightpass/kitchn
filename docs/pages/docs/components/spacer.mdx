# Spacer

The Spacer component is a versatile utility designed to simplify the process of adding consistent spacing between elements in your layout. By using the `x` and `y` props, you can easily control the horizontal and vertical spacing, respectively.

## Usage

First of all, you need to import the `Spacer` component from the `kitchn` package.

```js
import { Spacer } from "kitchn"
```

## Default

<Playground
  code={`
<Container>
  <Text>Before</Text>
  <Spacer y={2} />
  <Text>After</Text>
</Container>
`}
/>

## Props

| Name | Type | Default | Required | Description
|------|------|---------|----------|-------------
| `x` | `number \| string \| keyof Gap` | `1px` | No | Specifies the horizontal spacing. Can be a theme gap key, a number multiplier, or a CSS length unit.
| `y` | `number \| string \| keyof Gap` | `1px` | No | Specifies the vertical spacing. Can be a theme gap key, a number multiplier, or a CSS length unit.
