# Spinner

The Spinner component is a simple yet effective way to indicate that a process or action is currently loading. It displays three animated bouncing dots, making it clear to users that they should wait for the process to complete.

## Usage

First of all, you need to import the `Spinner` component from the `kitchn` package.

```js
import { Spinner } from "kitchn"
```

## Default

<Playground
  code={`
<Spinner />
`}
/>

## Size

<Playground
  code={`
<Spinner size={25} />
`}
/>

## Color

<Playground
  code={`
<Spinner color={"#ff0000"} />
`}
/>

## Props

| Name | Type | Default | Required | Description
|------|------|---------|----------|-------------
| `size` | `number` | `20` | No | The size of the Spinner, which controls both width and height in pixels.
| `color` | `string` | `theme.colors.accent.light` | No | The color of the bouncing dots. Can be any valid CSS color value.
