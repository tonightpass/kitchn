# Brands

We’ve created the following guidelines to help others use our brand and assets, including our logo, content, and trademarks, without having to negotiate legal agreements for each use.
Contact us and include a visual mockup for any intended use not covered by these guidelines.

## Tonight Pass

The Tonight Pass trademark includes the Tonight Pass name & logo, and any word, phrase, image, or other designation that identifies any Tonight Pass products. 
Please don’t modify the trademarks or use them in an altered way, including suggesting sponsorship or endorsement by Tonight Pass, or in a way that confuses Tonight Pass with another brand. 
For more information on correct usage, see [Usage and misuse](#usage).

  <Button prefix={<Icon icon={RiDownload2Line} />} type={"dark"} mt={"small"}>
    {"Download Tonight Pass Assets"}
  </Button>
</Link>

### Logo

<Container mt={"normal"}>
  <Container bga={"light"} px={"large"} py={128}>
    <TonightPassWordmark height={64} />
  </Container>
  <Container bga={"dark"} px={"large"} py={128}>
    <TonightPassWordmark height={64} fill={"white"} />
  </Container>
</Container>

### Icon

<Container mt={"normal"} row>
  <Container bga={"light"} px={"large"} w={"100%"} h={200} justify={"center"}>
    <TonightPassMark height={32} />

  <Container bga={"dark"} px={"large"} w={"100%"} h={200} justify={"center"}>
    <TonightPassMark height={32} fill={"white"} />
  </Container>
</Container>

### Spacing considerations

This “safety zone” ensures that graphic elements are included on printed matter, even in the event of printer offset. But also to let the logo breathe and not to stick elements to it.
