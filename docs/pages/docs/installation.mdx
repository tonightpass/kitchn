## Basic Installation

Kitchn is available as a [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/kitchn).

```sh npm2yarn
npm i kitchn --save
```

After installing Kitchn, you need to set up the `KitchnProvider` at the root of your applications.
This can be either in your `index.jsx`, `index.tsx` or `App.jsx` depending on the framework you use.

```jsx
import { KitchnProvider } from "kitchn";

export default function App({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return (
    <KitchnProvider>
      <TheRestOfYourApplication />
    </KitchnProvider>
  );
}
```
