# Contributing

Whether you're a beginner or advanced user, we welcome you to contribute to Kitchn. We have a contributing guide that will help you get started.

## Developing

1. Clone the Kitchn repository (download only recent commits for faster clone):
```sh
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/tonightpass/kitchn.git
```

2. Create a new branch **(the branch name must be written in lower case)**:
```sh
git checkout -b MY_GITHUB_USERNAME/MY_BRANCH_NAME origin/master
```

3. Enable pnpm:
```sh
corepack enable pnpm
```

4. Install the dependencies with:
```sh
pnpm i
```

5. Build the project:
```sh
pnpm build
```

6. Start developing and watch for code changes:
```sh
pnpm dev
```

### Running the apps separately

It might take a lot of ressources so you can run only the apps you need to work on:
```sh
# Terminal 1
pnpm dev:packages

# Terminal 2
pnpm dev:workshop
```

6.  Install the [Gitmoji extension for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=seatonjiang.gitmoji-vscode) for git commit messages.    

7.  When your changes are finished, commit them to the branch (**the commit message must be written in lower case**):
```
git add .
git commit -m "INSERT_THE_APPROPRIATE_GITMOJI_HERE DESCRIBE_YOUR_CHANGES_HERE"
```

8.  To open a pull request, you can go to [the "Pull requests" tab of our GitHub repository](https://github.com/tonightpass/kitchn/pulls), open your pull request, assign yourself to it, add the relevant label(s), add it to the "Kitchn Plan" project, then create it and link the issue you're solving to the pull request.

## Linting

The Kitchn repository runs [ESLint](https://eslint.org) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io) to lint and format all code and documentation.

To lint all code you can run:

```sh
pnpm lint
```

If you get errors, you can run the ESLint and Prettier auto-fix using:

```sh
pnpm lint:fix
```

Not all rules can be auto-fixed, those require manual changes.

### ESLint

We recommend installing the [ESLint plugin for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint).

You can find the enabled rules in the [ESLint config](https://github.com/AntoineKM/antoine/tree/master/packages/eslint-config-antoine).

### Prettier

We recommend installing the [Prettier plugin for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode).

## Building

You can build Kitchn, including all type definitions and packages, with:

```bash
pnpm build
```

## Openning an Issue

If you find a bug or have a feature request, please [open an issue on the GitHub repository](https://github.com/tonightpass/kitchn/issues/new).

Give as much information as possible, including the version of Kitchn you are using, and the platform/browser you are using it on, some code snippets, and screenshots or videos if possible.

## Openning a Pull Request

When you're ready to open a pull request, you can go to [the "Pull requests" tab of our GitHub repository](https://github.com/tonightpass/kitchn/pulls), open your pull request and link the issue you're solving to the pull request.

Please make sure to follow the [onRuntime Commit Convention](https://docs.onruntime.com/contributing/commits).

Explain what you did, why you did it, and any other relevant information that will help the reviewer understand your changes.
